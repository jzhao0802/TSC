Files and their brief description.

1. main.R
Main program for pre-processing library. It declares and initialises variables, sets 
flag for performing parallel or sequential processing, and invokes dependent functions.

2. SampAndRes.R
It generates training, validation and test sets as follows:                  
	1) a training set and a validation set (comprising TSC and / or non-TSC patients) 
	   are  generated are generated for model building and model selection                                                
    2) a new training set is generated by keeping non-TSC training patients and 
	   combining TSC training and validation patients                               
    3) a test set is generated that does not contain patients appearing in training       
       and validation set                                                                

3. NormAge.R
It performs scaling for age variables

4. MkDictEnvt.R  
It creates a create a dictionary of unique codes appearing in training set

5. MkFtVec.R
It generates feature vectors for patients

6. PrsTst.R
It generates feature vectors for non-TSC patients in test set. Data can be processed 
in parallel or in sequential mode

How to excute the code:

In function "main.R", give input and oputput file names, and set values varaibles.
Execute this function to generate feature vectors.

To perform experiments using SVMs, generate normalised data using this set of scripts.
